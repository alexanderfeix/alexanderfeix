# Hi, I'm Alex ✌🏼

I’m passionate about the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **Machine Learning**, with a focus on building practical solutions, exploring new technologies, especially in the field of **Generative AI**.

Previously, i completed some open-source projects which involved Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), model fine-tuning, machine learning algorithms and other relevant software-development projects, which can be found at my account here.

## 👨🏻‍💻 My Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Java, PyTorch, LangChain, SQL, FastAPI, Vector Databases, RASA, ROS
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- **Cloud**: AWS, Google Cloud
- **Other**: Docker, Git, Lovable, Cursor, Supabase, Streamlit, HuggingFace, Unsloth, Pandas, Matplotlib

## 🚀 Project Overview
- 👨🏼‍⚕️ **AI-powered Doctor Notes Application**
  - Fine-tuned a small language model on generating mental doctor note summaries, tags and risk-classification
  - Achieved 2-3x better tag precision/recall/F1 compared to the 1.7B base model, 98% JSON validity rate and
high-risk recall, and 48% Rouge F1 score
  - Crawled and cleaned 3000+ Reddit posts and generated 2000+ synthetic data
  - Tech: PyTorch, HuggingFace, Google Cloud, FastAPI, Python, React, Supabase, Lovable, Docker
- 👾 **Development of an AI-chatbot for the University**
  - Led development of a chatbot using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that answers student questions
about the university and its content
  - Tech: LangChain, Ollama, Vector Databases, RASA, SpaCy, Streamlit, SQL, Docker, Python
- 🏎️ **ML Path Planning for Autonomous Racing**
  - Concept design of a neural network that finds the optimal racing line through evaluation decisions for various
proposed paths
  - Tech: Python, ROS, PyTorch, Transformer Architecture
